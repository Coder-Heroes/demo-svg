#### Instructor: [Adi Purdila](https://tutsplus.com/authors/adi-purdila)

Figma is an interface design tool. While it’s similar in a lot of ways with apps like Adobe XD and Sketch,  the fact that it runs in the browser coupled with some awesome collaboration features makes it unique and very well received.

In this course you’ll learn the basics of working with Figma, from both a designer and a developer’s point of view.
